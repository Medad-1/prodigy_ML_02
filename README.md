# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

## Overview

This project implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments that can help in tailoring marketing strategies and improving customer engagement.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python). It contains various features related to customer demographics and purchase behavior.

## Key Features

- **K-means Clustering**: Implements the K-means algorithm to cluster customers into distinct groups.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Utilizes data visualization techniques to explore customer segments and their characteristics.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Provides insights into each customer segment, helping businesses understand their customer base better.
